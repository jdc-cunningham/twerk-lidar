I have unfortunately gotten sick, not sure what it is. I wear a mask but apparently it's only 93% PFE filtering... anyway not sure if it was fast food drive thrus/post office, or the crazy difference in temperature (mid 50's during winter). For context it's 54F now and tomorrow it will be in the low 20's.

Oh yeah they say masks don't protect you, they protect others. Could be that guy that old guy that snot rocketed into his hands and then touched the payment thing at the post office.

Anyway... I haven't done much of anything other than sleep.

I was thinking about it though, while looking around online I saw an online interactive 3D head. I was thinking those things are not designed through the display medium eg. webgl or whatever... so I can work in the environment I'm comfortable with (unfortunately threejs) and export it... how do you do that? Well I was looking around and found these file formats `glb` and `gltf`. So... I should be able to export the robot as is (at best) and I'm assuming through ThreeJS target the limbs and then I can move them... in real time in accordance to the positions of the servos/telemetery and what not.

So then I can get my 3D representation of this robot to reflect the estimated state of the real thing...

Anyway that'll be exciting.

Proof of concept links I'll return to later when I don't feel like ass.
