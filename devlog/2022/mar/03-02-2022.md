Oh my god I'm so annoyed with DHL right now, 3 different times they failed to deliver my phone ugh.

I'm just stuck too like I can't get it from some place because the places I pick either no longer exist or the delivery takes too long/the place is closed.

Then the support can't really help you because they do the same shit the support site does.

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I'm just so angry about that, like I can't do anything about it, I need to just accept this loss and forget I ever ordered this damn thing.

Anyway I'm going to get some work done here, my sleep pattern is completely f'd now.

I don't care anymore, I have 2 weeks to prototype a new app thing and I can do that at my own discretion.

I know forgive me for my problems that don't matter against a literal war happening sorry I am privileged.

Anyway let's get something done here... more than just remaking a gait 5x.

Quick stuff

- [x] get new pitch angles
- [x] do a full scan and plot make sure it looks right
- [ ] adjust it so a 90 deg wall looks like a wall

I really need to learn how to use this camera/the lense. Since it's using too low of an aperature where everything's blurry, doesn't need to be. It's not a macro shot of a flower or something.

The issue is when I use manual aperture the color is wrong... so yeah, I mean I'm a noob, I had a brief thing where I had to buy like every mm combo I could think of that got expensive, of course I bought second-hand no g-masters but yeah.

Damn the down angle is nuts not sure why

I need to check that from a front view it's still flat

The down 2 position dips too far to the left instead of just perfectly up/down

Alright... time to do some plotting/some math real quick

Then will move onto the linear acceleration/turn stuff will be neat to see like a course drift since the damn thing doesn't move straight

Well I got it plotted, it of course looks wrong/staggered from the body moving around, need to offset that.

I will use external measurements for the pitch, for sweep not sure... I should record a top view and that would give me the offsets.

It's like a tapering triangle I think, how does that look for a subtracting arc in math not sure yet.

I'm pretty happy with the Lidar's accuracy though, these tiles are 10" and it's beyond that for the 1ft.

A pro move would be to just click on the vertices on the chart and pull them backwards on a specific axis/freedom of movement, then you can definitely get your exact offset

But I'm a scrub so I won't do that, well... actually I will see if that's easy to do.

Nvm... that's not easy to do

Needs raycasting looks like (parrot speaks)

Ugh man these units are nasty


up2 3.13" -> 2.26" offset
up1 2.14" -> 1.64" offset
0.5" back level

Oof these offsets are not right hmm

I'm eyeballing it, the pitch looks good but the sweep needs work, I think it's a slope function. from a top view, I'll get a quick top view recording real quick

I have to keep making progress, I'm still distracted with my annoyance with DHL

20 degrees... oh... I just realized it's based on the arc of the robot swing around its center point

Well I can't really think right now, only do basic stuff, I want to post an update.

Heh... I have an idea, use your tools boy

It doesn't lose much though is the thing, the maximum is 0.18"

So pitch is the biggest problem

Actually I rotated the right part around the wrong axis, it rotates on the lower peg, modified math

Ehh... idk I need to work on this, one of the tasks I have to do is simplify this mesh for the collision/box bounding

Ehh... this sucks... it should show a 90 degree, straight up-and-down wall

Anyway I need to move on
