Oh my god I'm so annoyed with DHL right now, 3 different times they failed to deliver my phone ugh.

I'm just stuck too like I can't get it from some place because the places I pick either no longer exist or the delivery takes too long/the place is closed.

Then the support can't really help you because they do the same shit the support site does.

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I'm just so angry about that, like I can't do anything about it, I need to just accept this loss and forget I ever ordered this damn thing.

Anyway I'm going to get some work done here, my sleep pattern is completely f'd now.

I don't care anymore, I have 2 weeks to prototype a new app thing and I can do that at my own discretion.

I know forgive me for my problems that don't matter against a literal war happening sorry I am privileged.

Anyway let's get something done here... more than just remaking a gait 5x.

Quick stuff

- [ ] get new pitch angles
- [ ] do a full scan and plot make sure it looks right
- [ ] adjust it so a 90 deg wall looks like a wall

I really need to learn how to use this camera/the lense. Since it's using too low of an aperature where everything's blurry, doesn't need to be. It's not a macro shot of a flower or something.

The issue is when I use manual aperture the color is wrong... so yeah, I mean I'm a noob, I had a brief thing where I had to buy like every mm combo I could think of that got expensive, of course I bought second-hand no g-masters but yeah.

Damn the down angle is nuts not sure why

I need to check that from a front view it's still flat

The down 2 position dips too far to the left instead of just perfectly up/down

Alright... time to do some plotting/some math real quick

Then will move onto the linear acceleration/turn stuff will be neat to see like a course drift since the damn thing doesn't move straight
