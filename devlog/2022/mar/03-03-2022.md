Well the first attempt was not good for the linear accel.

I just sampled the entire forward walk gait which isn't always moving forward...

So the next time I'll isolate it.

I think I analyzed the math right but I only came up with 0.3" instead of 2" for the 2.5s sample

Not a good sign... second attempt not getting same values

need to do a test where I just manually move the robot through the air known distance/time and then see if it matches reality.

I don't know if I'm fudging numbers or what but I was able to get something close

What I don't undersatnd is the initial elapsed time... I have time stamps but the first one is 0... so for this initial sample is it 0 or does it have some elapsed time... seems stupid

The rest of them you subtract current - previous

My external world measurement is putting the robot near/over a tape measure and measuring how far it pulled the Lidar sensor's plate forward... it's just over 2in so this is not right but close.
