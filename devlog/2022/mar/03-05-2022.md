Alright just recently woke up, have to stay up till tomorrow night. I will commit to getting a lot of progress on this project done, fresh brain, let's go.

Yesterday I was trying to figure out what the minimum scan distances should be to make sure the robot does not miss something due to its blind spots.

I took an empty space scan for an idea of what to expect when there's nothing in front of the robot at least two 10" cube lengths.

Man it takes so much time to process these spreadsheets it still needs to be converted into math on the Teensy.

I've been thinking about plotting a line for the robot's movement in ThreeJS that'll be cool.

Hmm this plot looks odd... I wonder if the beam hit its leg or something, also for being in freespace the distances are close.
