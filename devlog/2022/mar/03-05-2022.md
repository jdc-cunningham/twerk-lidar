Alright just recently woke up, have to stay up till tomorrow night. I will commit to getting a lot of progress on this project done, fresh brain, let's go.

Yesterday I was trying to figure out what the minimum scan distances should be to make sure the robot does not miss something due to its blind spots.

I took an empty space scan for an idea of what to expect when there's nothing in front of the robot at least two 10" cube lengths.

Man it takes so much time to process these spreadsheets it still needs to be converted into math on the Teensy.

I've been thinking about plotting a line for the robot's movement in ThreeJS that'll be cool.

Hmm this plot looks odd... I wonder if the beam hit its leg or something, also for being in freespace the distances are close.

I'm going to visually check the angles to see if the ToF line of sight hits the leg or something.

wtf these dimensions don't make sense... it's open space and it's returning 1 or 2"... ugh

Also I think I know why it has a tendency to tip backwards the front-left leg is farther forward/not symmetrical with the back left leg... even so

It's odd, it's good for 6feet but it maxes out at 322mm

I also took out the high speed flag to not use the fastest eg. 20ms still having problems.

Idk if the sensor is bad or what, I bought three they're $10 each

I think it's just the open space, I'll try a different data type maybe that'll help ha

Still the same 322.44

Oh maybe I have to turn on long range mode.

Oh yeah says default mode is 1.2m and long range is farther.

I might have to switch betwee long range and high accuracy, I'm not sure how much better it is...

Hmm... no way high accuracy goes up to 200ms nope it's already slow as hell

Man... says 26 ft away for some measurements lol that's not right

Alright I will try default (33ms) but switch ToF sensors

Oh the allen wrench I'm using as a weight is shiny, the sensor is above this by about a quarter inch or more but let me see

Omg wtf... no difference still wrong values ugh

Let me try a new battery

No change wtf, well at least I socketed the ToF sensor

Ooh this looks better, they're like all maxed out at 322.44

Ehh I tried to go back to high speed but seeing too many non-near-infinity measurements so default measurement it is at 33ms so it got slower by like 50% more

Ahh man I gotta re-scan again oof, but that was a good find, if the measurements were bad would make this project even worse
