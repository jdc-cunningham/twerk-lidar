I have to do a major update/mental wrap up on this project and then devote myself to something else for a bit (work related).

Today I had an incident where as the sole-tech person I wasn't there (sleeping) during business hours. So until we can hire someone else that can do upkeep I need to get back on a regular schedule. I've been trying but my resolve has been weak.

Of course this problem was the standard pains of cross-browser-version feature support issues.

Immediate tasks:
- [x] check that turning is still good
- plot forward walking distance
  - this is good to get refamiliarized with the ESP-01 data transmission/real time plot
- plot turning as well
- make ThreeJS function to draw a cube
- do basic collision math

Ugh still having dumb problems like "this function comes after where it's called" which there is a fix for that not sure if it's namespace or something or class based, anyway...

I moved stuff around, man this code is super nasty now

Going to do hourly updates to make sure I make progress.

### 2 AM (2:06 now)

- created separate files for variables/telemetry, using `dumpData()` function to start telemetry plot.

So what has to happen is I perform the math locally for tracking move forward
- each step
- take ms elapsed
- multiply against m/s^2 to get velocity
- multiply to get f/s
- sum time, sum f/s and then multiply together (this is not great
  but incremental summing does not produce the right result)

nmapping if esp changed addresses

Still the same not connecting hmm

I was supposed to do a more thorough planning but I'll do all the bare minimum for now.

Thorough meaning based on sample available, minimum distances measured

There is still a buffer build up problem so I need to check that before writing to it

Ehh running into problems with strings/char/dynamic size

Sticking with String for now, tried std::string too

This approach will be nasty because I'm mixing "data types" well message types anyway.

String is general purpose if you parse it but yeah it's not JS running on a quadcore/lots of memory/etc...

Still dealing with the issue of double strings for stuff sent to ESPO1

Wonder if I need to flush on the ESP side

### 3 AM
Trying `Serial.flush()` call on ESP side

I still hae this problem of double messages

I don't get it, I use a local check, a Serial.flush() check it's still writing twice

I will try a millis call

Right now I'm using 1 second delay will try longer, that's working

I'm good with this because normally it would not send every second

I'm going to use some previously recorded values to populate fake sampling and write math against it.

3:52 AM
Performing first walk test with dumped elapsed distance compared against tapemeasure/real world.

Math is wrong...

### 4 AM
4:12 AM math still problematic, spreadsheet has it right, my Arduino math is wrong

4:35 AM
There is a weird discrepency where the elapsed time jumps from the standard 0.09-0.023 to 1 second it's odd

It might be when it does the pull forward command as it does happen at the middle of the measurements

The backwards tipping is nasty

Still getting wrong values, sucks to correct eg. expect to move 2" but measure 0.72"

Wtf something happened to Teensyduino not listening to flash/compile commands


### 5 AM
So I'm going to get the ThreeJS plotter working now.

Everytime it gets a `pos update, 0.00,0.00,0.00` command it will update the plot/add onto existing lines.

Cool so at this point I have a line that's plotting/updating as the robot moves forward.
