- [ ] fix gaits
  - [ ] forward
  - [ ] backward
  - [ ] left
  - [ ] right
- [ ] update sampling offets with measurements
  - means since the ToF sensor does not rotate about the same axis the measurements are off
- [ ] track the distance traveled using acceleration summing as it walks/moves
- [ ] plot the world using simple 3D boxes when an obstacle is found
- [ ] transmit data from robot to web interface by ESP for ThreeJS plotting
- [ ] actually do navigation and mapping
  - means I have a known physical world layout
  - I get something similar

Well... my Pinephone Pro still has not come in. The drop off point I chose no longer existed nice... so I gotta wait another day possibly two ugh...

I designed/submitted my proposal for this next thing I have to build.

Going to work on this some more then. I guess I neede sleep as I slept in till 1:30 PM today.

I'm going to use the gaits from [this robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvBVyJE9HOc) by Regis Hsu.

I'm watching how it positions and moves its legs then programming it for my robot.

I have to rework the initial stance

Man... I do not want to do this ha...

[Lmao it's stuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72OOZBOS9s0)... how is that even possible, to program a gait where it's walking in place

Well the walking has improved significantly I figured out what was wrong with the above, the back-right leg was not advancing far enough.

I also realized the legs needed to go up more so they don't snag on the carpet easily.

Well this is not great, it's not stable on the back legs... tips backwards

We interrupt this scheduled program to bring you

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

It still turns! omg... it is probably from the tipping to lift the back legs

need to do more analysis on why it sucks

I understand the real world is not ideal, it could step on a piece of plastic and slip... it should be able to adjust but when it clearly turns on a uniform surface? That's a problem

The thing is... it doesn't need to track straight for a long time... but a "long time" is several gaits, as in it's only maybe up to 3 feet but that's a lot of steps since it only moves like 1" per gait run.

One thing when I copied this gait, I did not do all of it... the front leg that goes forward pulls in with the outer leg... also when I do the tilting, maybe I should pull forward too, to lean that way (towards the front).

What's cool is I can globally slow the servo movement down where I can watch it eg. 6ms to 50ms per degree

Because the front-right or front-left leg that goes forward does "reach out" with its outer-most servo.

I also did something dumb earlier I made the robot rest all the way down on the floor and while it was able to get back up to go to the starting position, I heard a "servo gear strip" sound like oooh... I'm going to regret that later

Also this thing chews through battery.

I took the tipping out, added those "pull forward outer servo" things

It is a little tipsy but I think it's staying upright

I know what I have to do, but I don't think I have the strength to do it (Kylo)

I need to put a mass in front to make it not back heavy

I wish I could add something useful as a weight.

Well it has a tow hook in front now, I just glued a random allen wrench to it.

It still tips backwards though, I'm going to try wider arcs. It's doing 20 deg right now.

What's also odd is on a flat wooden surface the robot does not tip over but on carpet it does

Cracks open a NOS at 11:29 PM that's a fatal mistake

Well... I'm done... it goes straight for a bit but then for some reason later on the trajectory changes whether it's the ground or the random servo vibrations... so I will just have to make sure that the IMU catches the "drift".

Also with this front weight it is now a 10" cube robot instead of 8.5"

So now I have to make the rotation gait
