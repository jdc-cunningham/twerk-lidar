- [ ] fix gaits
  - [ ] forward
  - [ ] backward
  - [ ] left
  - [ ] right
- [ ] update sampling offets with measurements
  - means since the ToF sensor does not rotate about the same axis the measurements are off
- [ ] track the distance traveled using acceleration summing as it walks/moves
- [ ] plot the world using simple 3D boxes when an obstacle is found
- [ ] transmit data from robot to web interface by ESP for ThreeJS plotting
- [ ] actually do navigation and mapping
  - means I have a known physical world layout
  - I get something similar

Well... my Pinephone Pro still has not come in. The drop off point I chose no longer existed nice... so I gotta wait another day possibly two ugh...

I designed/submitted my proposal for this next thing I have to build.

Going to work on this some more then. I guess I neede sleep as I slept in till 1:30 PM today.

I'm going to use the gaits from [this robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvBVyJE9HOc) by Regis Hsu.

I'm watching how it positions and moves its legs then programming it for my robot.

I have to rework the initial stance

Man... I do not want to do this ha...

[Lmao it's stuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72OOZBOS9s0)... how is that even possible, to program a gait where it's walking in place
