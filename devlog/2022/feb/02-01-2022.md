Did a nice 8hr work day, feeling kinda spent

I'm going to fix the pitch gaits today and then I will continue with the sampling work.
I will need to add more steps to the angles.

Damn I'm feeling burnt, head's numb, eyes blurry can't really focus but will work on this

Oh no... one of the servos is acting up, front right middle it's just dead

It doesn't sit flat on the desk anymore hmm

Yeah I think the front right middle servo is messed up, I can move it and then it gets strong/reacts

Ahh crap I forgot I have to print a servo boot when replacing inner servos.

Well I'm going to game in the mean time.

I'm not even sure how this was damaged but I will remember this next time not to cheap out.
