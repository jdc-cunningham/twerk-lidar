Did a nice 8hr work day, feeling kinda spent

I'm going to fix the pitch gaits today and then I will continue with the sampling work.
I will need to add more steps to the angles.

Damn I'm feeling burnt, head's numb, eyes blurry can't really focus but will work on this

Oh no... one of the servos is acting up, front right middle it's just dead

It doesn't sit flat on the desk anymore hmm

Yeah I think the front right middle servo is messed up, I can move it and then it gets strong/reacts

Ahh crap I forgot I have to print a servo boot when replacing inner servos.

Well I'm going to game in the mean time.

I'm not even sure how this was damaged but I will remember this next time not to cheap out.

I think I'm just going to go ahead and print some in advance

I am looking forward to the day I can make a robot like that mini spot by Boston Dynamics with regard to the actuators, not this rickety servo piece of crap that I have.

Getting rekt

Well bf2042 crashed, time to get back to this.

I did realize I don't have to glue the middle servo boots

As they'll be held down by compression

Ugh... man the servos aren't even mirrored right... that's a big flaw of this robot is the hardcoded positions. It should ideally use the IMU to dynamically set the servos to whatever position they need to be to be level.

It's funny it doesn't even walk straight, it slowly turns right

I think that for a correct sweep/pan measurement I need to make the legs mirrored.

I'll check if I can lift the back-left leg up without it tipping over.

No it falls backwards but I can do the trick of tilting away from then forward.

Oh I bet since the power supply was mounted externally that shifted the CG backwards

Right now the robot is stable with the back-left leg down, it won't tip unless the back-left leg is moved up then it tilts backwards vs. forwards.

The intent is to move this offset back-left leg forward again so it is a perfect mirrored-x shape.

I don't know... it could shift forward except for the farthest back leg.

Then that could free the back-left leg... but idk if I even want to bother.

I need to get a "working thing" roughly and then improve upon it, rework it.

The copy/paste of data sucks.

And trying to make sure it all streams is touch and go... it could work, where you establish connection and dump a matrix to the web interface and then the web interface can deal with it with JS.

I just feel spent though like I'm going to go veg/do nothing.
