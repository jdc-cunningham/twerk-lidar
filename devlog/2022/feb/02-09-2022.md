I started another side project

This is still my priority though after day job

I'm going to get the angle pitched from NED today

I have some left over time before my usual day job ends

So I need to run the robot and get a coordinate output

Lol jump and `getDown()`

I have to put some tape between the two left legs as they start to oscillate/go crazy while in mid air.

Having weird problems... stuff's missing/undefined in this code all of a sudden

Oh no watching some Scott Manley, distraction, I am pretty tired today

Omg I have to stop watching stuff

I need to get this pitch measured against NED and see if it makes sense.

So sitting on the platform got 0, 0, -9.70

I'll rotate it by 45 deg visually and measure

0, 0, 7.16 ooh... positive?

Oh crap... it will always be down lol.

I need the NED

Yeah I want the angle... oh shit these are 90 degrees to each other hmm

Damn I suck at this the math, like why is it so hard to chop part of a 3D thing and get one plane out
