I started another side project

This is still my priority though after day job

I'm going to get the angle pitched from NED today

I have some left over time before my usual day job ends

So I need to run the robot and get a coordinate output

Lol jump and `getDown()`

I have to put some tape between the two left legs as they start to oscillate/go crazy while in mid air.

Having weird problems... stuff's missing/undefined in this code all of a sudden
