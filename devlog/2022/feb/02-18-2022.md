Today we're doing linear acceleration to estimate distance travelled.

You'll see in glorious HD how much of a piece of crap this robot is as it can't walk straight.

My cat's been wanting to chew things lately, now I have to hide the programming stand too.

I'm switching camera lenses I'm using a prime but it's in theory faster than the F4.

It is closer though... anyway let's go.

Man I feel beat/tired. I did just eat a lot.

I think I'm reaching my point where I need to f' off and do nothing for a bit, game or something.

Man... the walking is so bad. I thought I had it, but the balance is not good. It keeps dipping and it also does not walk straight.

I can't really do good estimations of motion if it can't walk straight.

Also the legs get caught easily, it is tape/not usual but still.
