Alright back on this, will start from the basics.

Just a basic sweep plotted as a line

Damn it I forgot the mod I put in

I will have to fix the outer legs when it sweeps so it doesn't slide around, I'm hoping/thinkig it's like the pitch... I'm just concerned about them clashing... worst case I can do that global position update to share it between the different commands.

Ahh man I feel spent... I'm close just need to step through it in parts.

One problem is the angle offset/mirroring it's all bunched on one side

In the level example the rotations go in one direction so yeah think that's why

Few things wrong, truncation for example

angle not being inclusive for negative check Z axis

Now cutting it in half to see if that plots on the right side of Y/north axis

Finally something that makes sense

I did force this into some nasty code to get it to work.

The errors just compound like the shifting legs.

The ToF distances are good too.
