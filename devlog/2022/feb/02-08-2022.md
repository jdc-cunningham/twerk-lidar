Alright... goals

I will fix the pitch up/down today. I'm already pretty spent but I think I can handle this.

I will also increase the slicing on the sampling I mentioned up to 5 horizontal rows.

I think I'll do that after I write the code to go through it/without me copy-pasting into a spreadsheet.

Ahh man I'm not feeling it, need to do it though, make progress.

I put a loop to tilt down, then up, ...

Yeah it's bad when it tilts down
