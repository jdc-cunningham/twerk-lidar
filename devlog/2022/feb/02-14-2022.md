Back on this again, got sidetrack with another stupid crypto trading project

I'll post that later after I let it run for at least a week untouched

So far I've been having to change it it's been slow because I did not mock things/just used it against the endpoints.

So the 5 min looper it takes that long for me to see some failure and fix it, and then it's still broken, so yeah...

So far I'm down 2% lol, it's definitely not a brains thing just because I can do it/try it sort of thing

Last time I was trying to figure out the pitch angle using NED, since the pitch gyro values were not good

This is hard for me since I'm not a math guy/have barely worked with vectors and thinking in 3D space

oh man my hands are sweatin... second energy drink
