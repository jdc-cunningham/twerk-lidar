Back on this again, got sidetrack with another stupid crypto trading project

I'll post that later after I let it run for at least a week untouched

So far I've been having to change it it's been slow because I did not mock things/just used it against the endpoints.

So the 5 min looper it takes that long for me to see some failure and fix it, and then it's still broken, so yeah...

So far I'm down 2% lol, it's definitely not a brains thing just because I can do it/try it sort of thing

Last time I was trying to figure out the pitch angle using NED, since the pitch gyro values were not good

This is hard for me since I'm not a math guy/have barely worked with vectors and thinking in 3D space

oh man my hands are sweatin... second energy drink

I'm already feeling spent but I'll push through

I really want to make progress on this project

Got the focus headset on let's go

Values for 45 degrees up approx

-3235.56
-331.37
-3108.15
-53.31
445.24
8.03
0.00
0.00
-7.25

Oh yeah... I could just do a comparison, this is level then measure at an agle and use trig

Not using NED at all

So -35.10 in f/s^2

The problem is I don't have a specific dimension to use like a hypotenuse

The hypotenuse is gravity but I don't have an agent height... maybe I can use the IMU height from the ground, not sure if that makes sense

Going to cheat with SketchUp since my dumb brain is having a hard time visualizing this
