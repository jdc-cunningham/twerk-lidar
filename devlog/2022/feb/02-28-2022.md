- [ ] fix gaits
  - [ ] forward
  - [ ] backward
  - [ ] left
  - [ ] right
- [ ] update sampling offets with measurements
  - means since the ToF sensor does not rotate about the same axis the measurements are off
- [ ] track the distance traveled using acceleration summing as it walks/moves
- [ ] plot the world using simple 3D boxes when an obstacle is found
- [ ] transmit data from robot to web interface by ESP for ThreeJS plotting
- [ ] actually do navigation and mapping
  - means I have a known physical world layout
  - I get something similar

I woke up very early today so I'm committing some fresh brain to this project.

Yesterday I wrote a new walking gait but it needed more work on clearance. I'm working on including the outer legs means adding more things to move up/down.

Sucks these are all manually programmed vs. coordinated/abstracted together.

Really been digging Beach Bummer by No Vacation

Put that on, morning sip of coffee

Yeah this is hard/confusing like the original servo movement function addressed servos by integers as opposed to the names of the servos.

I will separate out each sub-command of a gait to keep track of them more easily.

The other thing I mentioned in the past is without tracking the servos current positions every command has to know where it is in order to avoid jumping/fast movement of gears eg. smooth 90-90-40 vs. 50-40 (gets current starting pos wrong)

I'm going to get the Pinephone Pro soon that will derail me in projects/what I'm working on. I want to dump some time into that. Gotta produce that content.

Oof... I moved a lot of stuff around, lots of broken things

I think today I will get the new forward gait and turning gait done as well as updating the ToF measurements.

Maybe I'll do the mirrored gaits as well.

I primarily just want to get to a point where I'm just working on software/data and less of mechanical stuff.

Let's just take a stroll through memory lane, I just had a random flashback

I was sitting on my bicycle at this bridge... that was a bad idea, derailed my thoughts, made me sad too thinking about the past.

See at this time I was working at Red Lobster washing plates, sometimes as a deep fry cook (frozen stuff), stocking, cleaning, etc... I was trying to break into the tech industry, I'd been freelancing/knew how to make websites for a long time. Less so as a PSD-to-HTML guy but more I knew most of the parts required to get a site up eg. generate a CSR for SSL, bind parameters to avoid sql injection, hashing passwords... stuff like that.

This was my first real job and at $20/hr it was a step up from my current $11/hr or so.

Anyway I just remembered biking this distance, early in the morning (had to be up by 5 AM to leave by like 5:30 bike the 1.5 hrs), can't remember start time but it was an 8-5 kind of job. Catered food that was nice.

I did feel sad leaving them but it was capped they only did WP type sites I couldn't learn more.

Anyway that's that... I'm doing better now financially but I'm still negative net worth/not free.

My world view has expanded though as in I expect to get paid above $50/hr nowadays.

Although at this time I'm a parter/co-owner of something (should be working now lol but I worked over the weekend).

Anyway must continue, especially with fresh brain
