Losing the goal, need to step through it again

10:16 AM
making progress, just nasty code

I am not sure if I have enough storage, I tested roughly (text file) one scan set takes up like 3KB and the Teensy 4.0 has 2MB of flash storage.

There's also 2 sets of RAM according to Arduino output but not sure if they're part of the flash (don't think so)

I'll just do it/assume it'll fit.

The data has to get processed locally for the navigation but I'm also trying to work on the batchings/ending data to the web.

The web is faster to process data since I'm more familar with JS/more computation on computer side.

11:57 AM
I think I'm close to trying the code out for real, I need to make a receiving part on the web to write it to the screen to check all the data makes it.

Then I can start working on the plot.

Back on, dang the lidar scan is really slow huh

I have to reduce the sample count based on geometry, so 3.6 deg coverage vs 25 = less scans for the latter.

Also the web socket connection was lost and didn't reconnect.

Sample lidar every 3 degrees, short range sensor outer and middle

I killed the tfmini-s lidar by riping the connections off the pad, will put glue on those next time.

So I ordered more of those will come in Monday.

3:24 PM
Dang I'm feeling spent already, the TFmini-s dying was a bummer

Well I lost about 10 writes... hmm

Yeah now the socket keeps closing before it's done... I might have to "promisify" it... where after it's connected again, continue sending.

oh I see the web side is trying to poll the robot while it's in the process of sending data up, should wait.

Yeah it's always short... I should see if the data matches
