Losing the goal, need to step through it again

making progress, just nasty code

I am not sure if I have enough storage, I tested roughly (text file) one scan set takes up like 3KB and the Teensy 4.0 has 2MB of flash storage.

There's also 2 sets of RAM according to Arduino output but not sure if they're part of the flash (don't think so)

I'll just do it/assume it'll fit.

The data has to get processed locally for the navigation but I'm also trying to work on the batchings/ending data to the web.

The web is faster to process data since I'm more familar with JS/more computation on computer side.
