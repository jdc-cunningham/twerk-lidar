Feel like shit right now but let's go.

I bought MG90D servos to replace these cheap blue 9G servos... I had a panic attack when I read that the MG90D only goes 90 degrees... (maybe 120)

That could be bad... if I need more than that and it can't rotate that far.

Ahh... that completely derailed me, dumb me for impulse buying

Goals right now
* using mock data, filter on robot side
* figure out max string I can send
* write a queue that can send the entire data
  * send a starting flag to get into this mode
* then tie this into the actual scanning and receive it on web
* plot the received mesh

Damn I'm spent

I guess data length is not a big concern, because I'm able to send 200 characters, I could probably do 1000 easily, it just works.

Oh maybe there is a cap, I hit 263.

Okay so there is a cap 263 what does that number mean?

Wait I saw an 855 go through huh... but 263 is the norm.

I wonder if it's a time thing.

1400 went across hmm but 263 is common.

So I'll just set a hard chunk cap of 250 chars.

I gotta do some thinking real quick, these online C++ sandboxes are useful.
