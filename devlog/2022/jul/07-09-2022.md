So it turns out this "lidar" sensor does not shoot out a beam (guess it makes sense, where is the lense(s))

It shoots a cone, a big one too, 25 deg FOV

So I had to rework that, see below:

This means the pan-tilt sampling doesn't have to sample every degree, pretty much just the outer/middle points.

What's interesting is if the above is true then the closest measurement detected is 6.5" (down angle measurements)

I probably did a check for the 18" away using only the middle/up scans.

There are a few things I wanted to address today/this weekend.

The communications is one of them, since the Arduino/Teensy is not multi-threaded.

I have to come up with an async messaging system.
