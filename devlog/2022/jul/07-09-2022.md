So it turns out this "lidar" sensor does not shoot out a beam (guess it makes sense, where is the lense(s))

It shoots a cone, a big one too, 25 deg FOV

So I had to rework that, see below:

This means the pan-tilt sampling doesn't have to sample every degree, pretty much just the outer/middle points.

What's interesting is if the above is true then the closest measurement detected is 6.5" (down angle measurements)

I probably did a check for the 18" away using only the middle/up scans.

There are a few things I wanted to address today/this weekend.

The communications is one of them, since the Arduino/Teensy is not multi-threaded.

I have to come up with an async messaging system.

I'm trying to come up with a plan, my mind is kind of all over the place, need to aim for something to achieve

I still don't really have an exact design for the UI, I have some thoughts/features I'd like to have like an async/promise deal.

I am going to look at the ESP01's code again, to see how it deals with serial buffer buildup (from the websocket poll)

I'm also thinking about an acknowledge callback from the robot when it receives a message, it would also include the return payload if applicable

Like a battery voltage or something

Unfortunately it's not something like JSON, that could be a thing but I'm skeptical of the messaging reliability

Shorter = better sort of thing

Right now I'll work on the manual web ping to confirm this cone thing

Doing some ToF sampling

It is much worse the smaller or less direct the target is.

At 18" a flat plate like 8" is measured alright, it's a little more

But a target that's less than 2" is measured at 23" away

It can tell it's there but the accuracy is really bad, 23/18 so 22% wrong

Granted the target shrank is about 20 some percent the size of the original

I mean a cone is more ideal for my case since it moves less

I think what I'll do is keep my pan/tilt pattern but sample much less, like 5 samples per plane.

That should provide enough overlap

I tested the measurement at the max-right sweep and it measured 21 inches or so which was beyond the target plate

A simple test would be to do this modification, plus I caught some hard-coded distance subtraction from old code that I took out

So apply this ToF sample limitation then run the existing obstacle detection check

There is a pretty bad problem, when it runs into a wall and is just rubbing against it

Whether sideways or front-ways (no reverse command, this will be important to have)

It's currently not smart enough to know this, this is where an impulse detection would help with the IMU

Yeah it needs to use the IMU to detect something's wrong, like if it's not moving or the acceleration average is not expected/going in the right direction, something is wrong.

I will take a brief break, have some things to do.

12:01 PM

Have not left yet but just noting, I need to use the IMU and have a base to compare against, like this is a "normal forwards"
Scenario, nothing wrong, moved as expected

This is a stuck scenario, kind of deal
