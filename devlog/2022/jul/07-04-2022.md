I'm unfortunately rewriting code/not really making new progress

I'm adding some features though like the telemetry/web-call get battery feature

9:22 AM
Now I have to do some hard stuff, I updated the default stance of the robot so now all of the gaits have to get updated... this is where the "move by this amount, this direction" comes in because I don't have to be explicit... the `safeServoWrite` will check min/max throws of each servo before writing to it.

9:57 AM
Dang the forward gait is super screwed up now.

Oh it's the `safeServoWrite` checking crap

Walking looks fixed but it does shift to the right slowly over time... it remains parallel but the body drifts to the right. It still has that backwards tipping to the back-right corner.

I do want to "actually make progress" today which I don't know what that means.

Gotta verify the angle, `turnLeft()` still works thankfully

11:15 AM
Alright I got the new pan/tilt angles they definitely changed

Normally I would also go ahead and do a manual mesh plot dump... but that's like a half hour + process

I'm going to move on. I'll work on improving the navigation.

11:27 AM
The web commands don't work well with the motion code running, has a narrow window of opportunity to receive manual commands.

Also the ESP01 keeps crashing, probably too much uncleared serial buffer

Ohh... just had an idea, if it's flipped over send out an alert, means have to use IMU, I have NED down so could do it.

11:38 AM
I just did a corner wall test and if it is rubbing against the wall, the current draw is too high and it kinda dies softly.

Will need to monitor its progress like the upside down, died, stuff...

The single cell is probably a flaw in this robot due to the current draw, 2 cells would be better/run the servos at 6V or something.

So what do I do next?

1:35 PM (messing around with video)
I am thinking about this interface/the robot in general

The point of the robot (other than a mixed-learning tool) is to navigate and map

It should be able to operate on its own without me worrying that it will harm itself

For example if it runs into something, the servos will probably burn out, or the current spike will essentially make the robot shut down/stop functioning

I saw this happen when it ran into a wall... in the past when it fell forward/onto its ToF sensor plate, it burned out some servos

Which set me back in time when I replaced all the servos and had to reprogram everything AGAIN...

1:49 PM
Trying to figure out what to work on next, I'm working on the video(s) I want to publish today.

I think I will lay out the new interface/try to get the upside down notification thing too.
