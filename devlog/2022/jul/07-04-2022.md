I'm unfortunately rewriting code/not really making new progress

I'm adding some features though like the telemetry/web-call get battery feature

Now I have to do some hard stuff, I updated the default stance of the robot so now all of the gaits have to get updated... this is where the "move by this amount, this direction" comes in because I don't have to be explicit... the `safeServoWrite` will check min/max throws of each servo before writing to it.

Dang the forward gait is super screwed up now.

Oh it's the `safeServoWrite` checking crap

Walking looks fixed but it does shift to the right slowly over time... it remains parallel but the body drifts to the right. It still has that backwards tipping to the back-right corner.
