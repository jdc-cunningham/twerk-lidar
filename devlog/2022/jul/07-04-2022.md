I'm unfortunately rewriting code/not really making new progress

I'm adding some features though like the telemetry/web-call get battery feature

Now I have to do some hard stuff, I updated the default stance of the robot so now all of the gaits have to get updated... this is where the "move by this amount, this direction" comes in because I don't have to be explicit... the `safeServoWrite` will check min/max throws of each servo before writing to it.
