I want to get that mesh mapping to work from the robot straight to the web.

I'm currently making sure the pan/tilt motion is good. Right now it's doing something weird with one of the legs, it actually ends up crab walking over time which I will need at some point.

Dang one servo died

I'm not going to get it perfect, I'm going to move on.

Ugh... spent so much time messing around, it's still bad.

I'm going to move on. I need to do the external measurements for the new angles and offsets.

Then try to transmit the data to the web interface, from there I should be able to plot the meshes (both) to compare.

this is nasty but a real thing to factor

* tilt up 2
  * sweep
    * left
    * right
  * pitch
    *
* tilt up 1
  * sweep
    * left
    * right
  * pitch
    * 
* middle
  * sweep
    * left
    * right
  * pitch
    * 
* tilt down 1
  * sweep
    * left
    * right
  * pitch
    * 
* tilt down 2
  * sweep
    * left
    * right
  * pitch
    * 

ugh... it tilts to the right more than the left

also the body sways around a lot before settling/moving again

shiiiiiiitttt this footage is bad... I have to make it measure every degree which will slow it down.

The other thing to compensate for is that the body does not move symmetrically it starts moving backwards/to the right.

The other thing I have to update are the distance/offset per sensor

Based on the emitter location and height from the ground/distance from body center point.
