Thankfully I got the TFmini-s to work using serial.

I'm making a new 3D printed adapter to hold it based on the previous ToF mount.

I need to do some measurement averaging.

It is heavier, now weighs 10.5oz

The servos with my configuration, middle joints torque of 220grams 7.76oz to 3.8cm/1.5in

2.5oz or so per leg should be experienced.

So that should be plenty.

If it spikes to 3 say 3.5oz that's still within the rating above.
