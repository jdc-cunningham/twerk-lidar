Tried to get past the Lambda Calculus part of my Haskell book still stuck. Working on this project now.

Going to rewrite all the code (while borrowing from existing).

Just want to organize it/do it better so it's easier to extend.

12:47 PM
ehh... feel like I'm just shuffling crap around, am I really making new code?

Anyway I did use a struct so that's cool

12:57 AM
I'm going to setup that web-based manual servo position override, then I'll use it to move the servos in real time via websocket to their min/max positions.

2:01 PM
Ran into a problem with the structs as I was flexing the `getServoByPin` method.

3:13 PM
Apparently the way I was doing my structs is super f'd so I'm working on fixing it.

5:03 PM
So I have set the min/max pos of each servo... it's kind of confusing because depending on the servo's orientation 0/180 can be flipped... but overall it's still the right bounding, just the direction may not be intuitive.

Also reworking the manual start/end calls to use the total deg coverage will suck.

The point of reworking them is to hopefully "easily" flex them for reverse, it's more important for the motion gaits vs. scanning.
