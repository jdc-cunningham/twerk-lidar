Tried to get past the Lambda Calculus part of my Haskell book still stuck. Working on this project now.

Going to rewrite all the code (while borrowing from existing).

Just want to organize it/do it better so it's easier to extend.

12:47 PM
ehh... feel like I'm just shuffling crap around, am I really making new code?

Anyway I did use a struct so that's cool

I'm going to setup that web-based manual servo position override, then I'll use it to move the servos in real time via websocket to their min/max positions.

2:01 PM
Ran into a problem with the structs as I was flexing the `getServoByPin` method.

3:13 PM
Apparently the way I was doing my structs is super f'd so I'm working on fixing it.
