Tasks

- [ ] fix distance detection algo
- [ ] fix the rotation of the boxes regarding angles/direction turned
- [ ] add the two missing directions (right/back)
- [ ] add manual control by web

This might be too ambitious, I've been up for like 9 hours now. But I wanted to work on this project since it has a following/want to do something to improve it.

I will save the detection algo last since that's involved/hard and I'm spent already.
