I'm going to work on updating the depth mapping.

The dimensions changed and new measurement sensor.

I'll first film the pan/tilt motion as is to get the externally video verified pan/tilt angles.

Then put those in the global variables.

Ugh the gait is nasty particularly on the most downward one. The back left leg moves too far inwards.

Ahh man... the gaits are messed up, when it tilts up the back-left leg is too far down.
