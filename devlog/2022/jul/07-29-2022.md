Ugh....... REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Have to reprogram all of the servos again...

I think I have to reprint the outer legs, because the bend is too much/points the legs inwards.

Damn... that's like 3 hours more of printing. It's worth it though, I can see the leg slipping.

Software won't fix that.

I just realized when I put these new legs on, it will change the robot's position again... so I'll hold off on updating the pan/tilt till these new outer legs are in place.

It's crazy how tall the clearance can be on this robot
