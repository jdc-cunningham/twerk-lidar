Working on this, been a bit. I'm also working on this "Solar-chan" project on the side but I'll work on this while my brain is not spent yet.

Got stuck dealing with crypto and taxes. I ate it/so broke.

I'm back to what I was trying to do before which was modify the walking gait so it moves less/hopefully avoids tipping.

I do like this macbook just well made and the display is nice, too bad about the battery.

Other thing I will work on is the actual scanning/mesh collision checking
