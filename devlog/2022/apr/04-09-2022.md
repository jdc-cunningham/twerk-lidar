Working on this, been a bit. I'm also working on this "Solar-chan" project on the side but I'll work on this while my brain is not spent yet.

Got stuck dealing with crypto and taxes. I ate it/so broke.

I'm back to what I was trying to do before which was modify the walking gait so it moves less/hopefully avoids tipping.

I do like this macbook just well made and the display is nice, too bad about the battery.

Other thing I will work on is the actual scanning/mesh collision checking

Looks like I'm reducing the movement by 10 degrees

I did notice one set is wrong, let me check if that missing 10 degrees helps real quick

Did not help, it's so annoying this shaking/crappy servos

Nope made it way worse, can't even move forward, tips on both sides

I could lower the front-left side while the back-right leg swings forward.

Nope did not work either

1:43 AM

I need to make some big strides soon so I will have to stop screwing around with this

I could sway it to the front-left direction

It kind of helps but makes it start turning to the left more
