Improve the scanning, check the width

Other important thing is adding from d2 with d1

It should not just be 3 gaits forward maximum

Should check if it's an open space in which case it could move say 7 gaits instead of just 3 assuming d1 is clear.

Also keep in mind the edges/arc with the debouncer

Add the rest of the gaits (turn right and reverse)

Factor in IMU so you don't ram into something/burn the servos out

Also do pre-emptive scan termination if something is very close, don't proceed with the rest and just turn/back away
