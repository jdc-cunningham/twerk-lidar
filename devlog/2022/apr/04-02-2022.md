A bit spent today, long work session recently. But here I am, I have some desire to work on this project.

I want to modify the walking gait to see if it moves less (forward/back) will the tipping be reduced.

- [ ] modify walking gait

Then I'll work out the scanning frequency based on the scanning pattern used currently.

Maybe I'll get the object detection to cube stuff worked out to be transmitted to web interface.
