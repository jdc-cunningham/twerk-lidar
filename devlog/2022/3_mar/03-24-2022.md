Man it's crazy how life just changes abruptly.

Got a real kick in the face recently, sucks.

Goodbye sir.

I was going to mess around and transmit a full scan remotely, I didn't think I would do this because of how much data each scan is and how unreliable the serial/ESP/Wifi bridge is.

But I'll try it... what's reliable is a Python socket on a Raspberry Pi but this robot doesn't use a Pi.

Anyway this weekend I'll put some time into this project again, already spent now.
