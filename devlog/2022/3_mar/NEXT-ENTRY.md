Just had a thought

When doing the mesh plot and transmit, also have toggle-able scans...

Means the Teensy-ESP bridge has to be good enough to transfer all of those data points but yeah.

That way you could have buttons on the ThreeJS map to toggle between the basic cubes and the actual scan profiles.
