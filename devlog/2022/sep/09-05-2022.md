Ooh yeah day off

I have been working on adding a MOSFET switch to the TLR since after I upgraded the servos to MG90Ds they have really bad start up jitter. So bad that I usually have to turn the robot on/off several times before it gets to a normal state.

I am taking this switch I got help on from [allaboutcircuits](https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/having-problems-trying-to-get-a-high-side-switch-to-work-3v-switching-on-5v.177928/) for my moisture sensor project from more than a year ago.

Unfortunately I did not think about trying ot really make the board small. So it's a pretty big additional board.

I'm also concerned if the sensors will not like that slow startup vs. immediately on.

I decided to use pin 23 for the switch, since that's easy to get to from the top/not used currently as far as I'm aware.

Crap... I'm already using 23 for the LED dang

well... that was kind of a waste of time, I've been working on this since 9 AM so that's great

Trying the capacitors route

In the end I just used another power supply, it directly powers the Teensy. Arguable it's a waste but it works.
