More navigation shenanigans

11:33 AM

I'm just going to assume the last measured angles (pitch and sweep) are accurate and model the navigation plan off that.

The ToF sensor has a sampling delay of 20ms or so... TFMini-S has a 30ms delay

Looking at the ToF CONE model, it looks like  

Assumptions:
- robot moves 2" forward per gait
- robot is 8" tall, 8.5" wide (not counting leg arc), 7.5" long
  I have it as a 12" cube though for safety, I did some overhead shots before
  watching it turn and yeah

OMG I just remembered how I accidentally formatted my 3TB HDD that had all my old footage oof.

Another thing I'd like to fix is the robot does not move forward straight. So reduce motion on some legs so it moves straight. I think last time I looked into it the problem is losing grip/leg moves too fast. They're all coordinated together but some legs have to cover more ground than others.

11:53 AM

Doing some thinking/planning with the dimensions in mind and modeling in 3D.

12:22 PM

still doing modeling/measurements

think it's time to do some testing again, see what this robot can do currently

specifically looking for turning radius, min distance from targets

I have some values down already but doesn't seem to make sense

Ehh... I've done this before but I forgot, I'll check the turning radius inside a 12" square.

12:46 PM

After the left turn, front left leg middle joint is not down correctly

12:53 AM losing focus

1:44 PM

I'm still unsure what the TFmini-S is for... I mean I stuck it on there "more accurate"

The large FOV of the purple sensor is a good thing it turns out, it's safer/less scans.

Scanning is expensive, time and power consumption (all the servos move)

So it would be nice to determine if you can walk far before the next scan or not, that's where the TFmini-S comes in.

not able to focus

2:19 PM

still screwing around with dimensions
