I actually had a dream about some kind of legged robot moving. Except its design was a little different it looked more like a hermit crab.

Probably because I was imagining the motion with my hands and the curling of my fingers blended with the design of the robot... anyway weird.

Let me see if I can get this thing moving. I feel terrible right now. Not sure if from binge eating or something else, just feel tired.

Nope... I can't... I need to remember how this thing works that coordinates all the servos in motion.
