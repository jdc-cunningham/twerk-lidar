Tasks
- [ ] determine min heights on legs
- [ ] determine forward walk drift angle for pos tracking
- [ ] determine scanning logic
- [ ] factor in IMU anomaly if ran into something
- [ ] test detected sizes, seems like it can detect a pen but that's up close

I've been thinking about this... have some new thoughts for the scanning stuff (optimization)

It does suck that the robot can run into things like a lip on the ground and it would be invisible to it.

That's where the IMU comes in to detect any unusual trajectory/motions.

Thoughts:
- when the robot is standing/about to move forward, scan near and far with ToF and Lidar
  - something detected, abort or don't go very far
  - nothing, keep going with the scan
    - the scans have a range per step, anything fails in those ranges, abort the rest of the scan (finish sweep, no depth sampling)
- accounting for drift (robot slowly turns left as it moves forward)
  - film top view (drew "parallel" lines on cardboard)
- account for height clearance
  - film side view, pause the leg raise parts of gaits to measure
  - concern with fixing the above is to try and not affect scanning due to calibrated angles
- thinking about do I sample the IMU all the time or just moving forward

I almost regret putting the lidar on it... it's great for accuracy/long distance but the sampling rate sucks...

I could probably use continuous mode or something if accuracy is still good

I still need to determine how many scans I can do with lidar due to its narrow FOV

Some key rules:
- need 3" away from sensor bed to be able to turn
- robot moves 2" forward every full walk gait

if it detects a wall (large surface) and it turns, it's possible the right side will run into the wall still...

don't know if should default to 2 turns or check the right side

Generally want to follow simple/fastest checks

So

- turned
- do directly ahead scan to see if there is a wall there still
- will be a ping 5-6 inches away, should use lidar due to angle of wall, but lidar sucks...

can test with led blink

problem is if there's no edge on the left side of the middle, then it'll think it's clear, so should still scan on the right side

it will re-scan anyway, short circuit will deal with right side, since right side is scanned first anyway... sucks for right turn but can't turn right atm anyway

modified turn so left legs don't hit each other, need to measure angle again

44.5 deg new angle, that's cool it's almost 45 degrees
