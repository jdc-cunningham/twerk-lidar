Back at it again want to get that angle and move forward

So the tilt seems to be 6.4 degrees (camera SketchUp external measure)

The servos moved... 20 degrees, and the outer ones moved as well

I just had a thought (ooh) I can skip all the math crap for now and focus on that later (a project specifically on a better IMU) and since the tilts are known I know what they should be.

So... yeah I'm down for that... because I could learn how to use the angle between two 3D vector formula and extract the part specifically for pitch... but I'm not sure if my IMU is even working right.

It's like NED/I'm looking at a map/I know which way is North, of course... the direction of North can change (into the ground) even so... the axes on the IMU do not behave the way I expect them to, I keep fitting the output to what I expect should happen.

So yeah... I will manually get 5 tilt samples, verify them by video stills and then use that to work out calculations.

Unfortunately I need two more pitches which means I gotta program two more tilt up/down commands

But I'm down... at least I'm not stuck

Oh yeah I do need to get the geometery min/max distances based on tilt but that's easy in SketchUp

Tasks:

- in SketchUp do the base dimensions/arcing to see where the beam will be
  - gives min distance away
- add two more tilt up/down... probably just 10 degrees vs. 20 degrees
  - check these angles in Sketchup/what sampling they add
- start developing the mapping stuff based on ToF responses
- (probably too far)
  - transmit these dimensions as cubes and plot in ThreeJS world

at 6.4" down (current tilt) it measures very far away eg. 32.63" away

The other two tilt samples will need to be even further, a simple one is to do twice what is there now

Here it's lookin as close as 17.38"

The upper scan is far though for height clearance it's 48.7" away but the lower scans should catch anything in front

Also this distance is within the 6' suggested operating range

Wow this angle is actually insane damn, it's very steep, this `tiltDownFurther()` function

13.1 is the second angle

Ehh... I just feel weak need to get the pump, get this done, the micro crypto trader project has distracted me due to my own crappy state management, it keeps breaking but I think I have it nailed down now, it's up at least not in loss but I think generally crypto is on the upswing so it was bound to happen (why don't you buy more) well I've been rekt already at least $1.6K down at this point in recent time.

So I'll get the new tilt up/down things in placea and then record it doing it to confirm the angles

Let's go I summon thee power of Death Grips

So now I have those tilts and their angles which unfortunately is not mirrored but I'm past the point of caring now I need to make bigger strides.

So it's going to tilt all the way up, then go the right, then follow an S pattern like this:

```
---------- (12.3)
|
---------- (6)
         |
---------- (level)
|
---------- (-7.4)
         |
---------- (-13.9)
```

Of course I still have to track linear acceleration to track it moving and the rotations

Crap sweep is sliding around, also the servos seem clsoe to running into max endpoints/stripping, these things suck, I have already started looking for other servos specifically with metal gears.

Ultimately won't use servos but some kind of BLDC actuator or whatever

Sweep looks like I will need to do some adjustments there as well

Ahh man... if I adjust the outer servos on the sweep then the pitch outer positions will be affected as well/have to sync them

So the lowest down angle has a clearance check of 13.66" away

Ha... I just remembered I don't think this thing can turn yet... I have to go back to a mirrored x-shape from the standing/walking pose and then turn.

An immediate goal is to dump data from the full scan process

Log it then plot it in ThreeJS manually

I made a plane mapper ("mesh"?) from points from my "Sensor Fusion CLU" project that went nowhere

I can see the shifting around issue due to the sweep... a possibility is tracking the outer leg positions in an external variable and using those/pulling them in per motion so they line up

But there's still so much to this project to do and I'm trying to finish it in this month.

Next month I should have th Pinephone Pro and will work on an app for that.

I don't have a lot of money at the moment so that's why I can't like buy a bunch of parts for the future robot, I can work on parts of it. The future robot is going to be bigger/stronger/better (we can build him...)

It's inspired by this Star Wars laser spider droid thing with regard to very long/tall legs but it's still a quad design

It's the big one without eyes, the rods lift up/down via a pinion rack gear, that'll be cool to design/print

This is going to be a lot of data to copy/paste

It's actually concerning when the robot is in the farthest downward tilt and it is looking left, the beam is running into the closest leg... so I'll have to limit certain distances as in bad measurements.

This project needs so much time but I don't have it, so I'm doing large sweeps where it accomplishes most target goals even if poorly.

I mean at the bare minimum if it can navigate better than an ultrasonic sensor/perfect reflective walls then great... but it would be nice to also do internal mapping/remembering where things are. As well as showing that graphically.
