A day off nice...

Gonna get the pan-tilt stuff updated. I have to fix a leg right now as it's not mostly vertical in the neutral state.

I think future gaits I write will use the other method where it's not hardcoded values rather a "move by this amount" and then some abstracted underlying math does the calculations/keeps global servo positions updated.
