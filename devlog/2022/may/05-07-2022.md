A day off nice...

Gonna get the pan-tilt stuff updated. I have to fix a leg right now as it's not mostly vertical in the neutral state.

12:46 PM
I think future gaits I write will use the other method where it's not hardcoded values rather a "move by this amount" and then some abstracted underlying math does the calculations/keeps global servo positions updated.

Man... got so many things to update (cries)

Let me check the forward/turn gaits real quick make sure they still look good after the recent changes.

DOES... NOT... WALK... STRAIGHT!!! REEEEEE

I have to fix the turning because the outer legs are too far out and the leverage is too much for the servos, current draw gets too high it just dies.

Ehh... this is not something I want to fix now, I'll just keep in mind not to turn too many times in a row.

I'll probably do a code-refactor at some point

Think the fix is to curl the outer legs inwards during the pivots so they're closer to the body/less moment arm.

These servos are garbage and I was stupid to use them in a robot.

Looks like the back left leg does not go as far back hence the tipping

back left leg loses grip too

It still slowly turns left but it's good enough
