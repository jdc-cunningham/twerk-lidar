A day off nice...

Gonna get the pan-tilt stuff updated. I have to fix a leg right now as it's not mostly vertical in the neutral state.

I think future gaits I write will use the other method where it's not hardcoded values rather a "move by this amount" and then some abstracted underlying math does the calculations/keeps global servo positions updated.

Man... got so many things to update (cries)

Let me check the forward/turn gaits real quick make sure they still look good after the recent changes.

DOES... NOT... WALK... STRAIGHT!!! REEEEEE

I have to fix the turning because the outer legs are too far out and the leverage is too much for the servos, current draw gets too high it just dies.
