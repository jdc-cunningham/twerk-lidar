A bit spent but I think I can get something "significant" done here.

I'm going to make a function to plot cubes in ThreeJS. These cubes will be able to accept a size and orientation/angle.

Trying to think how you would plot a cube. I have plotted planes before, need four points.

And just rotate the angles by 90 deg.
