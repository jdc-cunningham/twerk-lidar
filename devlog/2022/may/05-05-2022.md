Gonna put some work into this. Been working non-stop lately.

Mentally spent right now, need to stay awake a little longer before I sleep some and work some more.

I am going to update the servo positions since the most recent servo replacement.

It feels more solid though overall like the gears aren't worn down or something.

Man this is so screwed up... ugh

It's not walking straight, it's tipping, legs are hitting each other oof

6:43 PM
Working on updating the pan-sweep stuff... have to re-measure the tilt angles externally.

The IMU approximates the sweep.

This is not an ideal robot, an ideal robot you could break its legs and it would adapt/keep going.

That's Arnold in a nutshell

Oh man... this is gonna take work, reprogramming the pan/tilt sampling ahhh... pain

7:21 PM
It tilts way too far forward

That's with only updating the tilt commands though need to update sweep as well

7:29 PM
Going to need to put more time into this, the beam got narrower instead of 40 deg/20 per side, it's down to 30. Also it still tips too far forward/back-left leg is in the air.

Gotta step through it
