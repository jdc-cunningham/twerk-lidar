Feel like shit right now but let's go.

I bought MG90D servos to replace these cheap blue 9G servos... I had a panic attack when I read that the MG90D only goes 90 degrees... (maybe 120)

That could be bad... if I need more than that and it can't rotate that far.

Ahh... that completely derailed me, dumb me for impulse buying

Goals right now
* using mock data, filter on robot side
* figure out max string I can send
* write a queue that can send the entire data
  * send a starting flag to get into this mode
* then tie this into the actual scanning and receive it on web
* plot the received mesh

Damn I'm spent

I guess data length is not a big concern, because I'm able to send 200 characters, I could probably do 1000 easily, it just works.

Oh maybe there is a cap, I hit 263.

Okay so there is a cap 263 what does that number mean?

Wait I saw an 855 go through huh... but 263 is the norm.

I wonder if it's a time thing.

1400 went across hmm but 263 is common.

So I'll just set a hard chunk cap of 250 chars.

I gotta do some thinking real quick, these online C++ sandboxes are useful.

This is hard, if it was JS I could do it pretty quickly but C++ I have to translate the code/figure out how to make a 3 dimensional array and then iterate over it/until all sent.

Using C++ shell

```
// Example program
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>

int main()
{
  std::map<std::string, std::map<float, float>> tiltSet = {};
  tiltSet["tilt-up-2"][3.5] = 5.9;
  
  
  
  for (auto it = tiltSet.cbegin(); it != tiltSet.cend(); ++it)
  {
    std::cout << it->first; // tilt-up-2
    
    for (auto it2 = tiltSet[it->first].cbegin(); it2 != tiltSet[it->first].cend(); ++it2)
    {
      std::cout << it2->first; // 3.5
      std::cout << it2->second; // 5.9
    }
  }
}
```

The sampling in MovementHelpers.h is a cluster f

Ugh... I could do the above but the easiest thing to do is just send this data to the web.

ugh... what I'll actually need is a map -> map -> array

ex.

"tilt-up-2" -> 44806 -> [0, -0.31, 47, 66] // maps to servoPos deg, gyro deg/s, depth in, lidar depth

my code is nasty, I need a fresh brain to work on this (whole day) so I think I will save this work for Saturday
