Tasks

- [ ] fix distance detection algo
- [ ] fix the rotation of the boxes regarding angles/direction turned
- [ ] add the two missing directions (right/back)
- [ ] add manual control by web

This might be too ambitious, I've been up for like 9 hours now. But I wanted to work on this project since it has a following/want to do something to improve it.

I will save the detection algo last since that's involved/hard and I'm spent already.

Well that did not go well... trying to extend a piece of crap, results in still a piece of crap.

So I'm going to work on the slightly improved version of this code, I'll just start a new branch, mostly a clone of this branch but strip the code out entirely and start from scratch, referencing the code in this branch.

The previous code is kind of all over the place and the manual gait part is a problem.

I don't have a fix for that right now, I still have to research on concepts like inverse kinematics to see how they apply here, as well as leveraging the IMU on board to align the legs/self stabilize and contribute towards the gaits. It would be nice if I had servo strain gauging to reduce current draw overall but that would require either many current shunt inputs or some kind of "multiplexer" or multi tap, idk... it's not impossible but not factored into this robot's design.

Also this robot is using shit parts, so it sucks.
