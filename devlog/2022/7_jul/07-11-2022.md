8 PM

Ehh... kind of spent already but I will do something. I was supposed to this weekend but I got side tracked/flew the Vortex 3.

Will add the upside down notifier/basic web app layout.

Problem is I still don't know what the layout looks like.

8:11 PM losing steam, haven't even started yet

9:19 PM
Made good progress, there's no structure to it but I'm getting somewhere

9:46 PM
I'll need to add an "unlock" function after it has flipped upside since when that happens, on the robot side it prevents itself from moving by setting a stop flag to true.
