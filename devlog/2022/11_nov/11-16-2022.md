on the PBP right now

going to go through this Inverse Kinematics video, thinking about it, seems like a good idea/directly applicable to this robot with the three joints per leg

Saw this video recently

has isosceles case

well this video was shorter than I thought, also only covered easy case

I need to bust out my robot and get dimensions, I hide it in a drawer so my cat doesn't chew on the wires

oh damn... I committed to the future! my dual-boot OS booted into Ubuntu and then back to Win 10, the time got messed up... didn't reset while fixing repo, oh well.
