A bit spent but I think I can get something "significant" done here.

I'm going to make a function to plot cubes in ThreeJS. These cubes will be able to accept a size and orientation/angle.

Trying to think how you would plot a cube. I have plotted planes before, need four points.

And just rotate the angles by 90 deg.

7:17 PM
Ehh cube has 6 faces I'm just setting them up manually

8:10 PM
hmm... rotating a plane interesting

really I just have to rotate the starting points but the 0, 0, 0 point is not "0" if you want to be able to rotate it.

I think I actually have to split the two points in half and rotate them in opposite direc

lol.. or... use ThreeJS whichh as built in cube methods

Yeah it treats the cube center as the centroid

OMG... lol so [easy](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/rotate-and-scale-geometry/880)...

Now we're jammin

8:30 PM
Ugh... stuck why is it not moving to the right

OMG it's slightly off like ahhh

it's weird 45 degrees doesn't look like 45 degrees, not sure if it's a screen "tare" thing that thing where it cuts what you can see... forget the term.

WTF is this, this is not 45 degrees

OMG it's using radians damn it... I probably did this before to make the mesh plotter

OMG there it is... beautiful 45 degrees

MF... JS is in radians too ahhh okay I'm getting there

OMG finally...

Okay... so at this point when it does a scan, I should be able to send the dimensions of the cube and sweep angle(s) and then see it plot on the web interface.

Of course I still have to work out the logic on the scan, I have to find the dimensions again and figure out the expected "bumps".

Neat side thought, a robot controlling another robot, like I could make an "API" of the first robot I made so it can be controlled by the other one... hmm.

Okay... I'm going to simplify it... if

10:03 PM
Okay so

these values have at least 1" over estimation ex. d2 is really 12.6

u2 -> 18"
u1 -> 18"
m1 -> 18"
d1 - > 18" ok (8x forward gait)
d2 - > 11" ok (4x forward gait)

Okay easy approach, split the scan into four quadrants, if there's a hit in any quadrant, draw a box of the same size (quadrant width) which is 3" based on the minimum 6" wide (per side) at 18" away.

The 58.8 degree turn sucks, that's such a giant space skipped over.

You should be able to turn specifically at some angle.

Immediate goals:
- [x] update the old obstacle detection to include update dimensions above
- [x] transmit the coordinates to the web interface
- [x] accept coordinates on web interface and plot the cubes
- [ ] check how it does, the obstacle stuff still sucks really need to
  - it will suck it's very vague

10:29 PM
For now I will just assume if any obstacle is hit at whatever distance, it is a cube as wide as the beam scan.

This is because the sweep has overlapping parts... the web part strips that out but I can't easily tell where the middle is per half of the valid data/not duplicate/overlap.

The sweepAngle is not correct, just based on the robot's position/current angle based on any turns it has performed/58.8 degrees and then subtracted from 360.

Okay there is something hard too... the cumulative distance traveled would vary and that affects where the cubes are on the Y axis... will need to work on that further.
