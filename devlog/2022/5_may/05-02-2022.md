A brain dead day today, so going to replace all these servos.

Doing all is probably excessive but I want to make sure they're all good going forward.

And the code will ensure that I don't burn the servos out (try not to).

While there isn't like a switchable current shunt on here to read current draws per servo... well I'm just making that point.

I thought about it how to monitor the current draw per servo.

What'll be neat is some servo boots will be new/using white PLA so it's like a highlight/adds character.

front-left done

4:12 PM
back-left done

concerned about slight variation between servos changing the angles

I start with the outer most servo first, power on briefly to move the servos to "upright" starting position. Then unplug the outer original servo, plug the new servo in, match the servo arm position (while powered) then I pull the old servo out and put the new one in. Repeat x12 ha

4:46 PM
front-right leg done

5:24 PM
Assembled but having problems with original alignment/body leveling... probably will have to modify the servo positions to level it.

5:41 PM
The servo positions will have to get re-adjusted along with the motions since during the pan-sweep the back-left leg isn't even touching the ground.

Will have to record videos of it doing stuff and then observing what needs to get changed.

For one the body is not level starting out.
