So this is a rare day where I work back to back... my sleep pattern's reversed right now so I need to flip it where I sleep at night and awake in the day time.

I'm currently designing the laser pointer holder that I will print in the morning.

Hehe this is quite a sight.

What will be interesting is the real math where I have to somehow store x,y,z points from the samples... although initially they will just be depth. I don't have real positioning yet until I actually use the IMU.

No... I'm not going to print this, I need to do this now. I will use a wire from a ground flag marker thing.

I have a whole stack of them but I can't find one. Found one

Yeah this will work for an approximation. I'm going to put a delay per command to see it more/exaggerate.

It kinda looks like a tank. Those are cool designs, 86!

Well look at that, two pieces of wire and we're good. This is not that accurate but good visual of what's happening.

Scan dimensions: 19.25" by 8.75" at a distance of 31.5"

One good thing from this is I realized my sensoring area is a wide AR/rectangle as opposed to a square, makes sense, it tilts up less than sweeps.

This is not that accurate because the laser while not perfectly straight, is also sticking far ahead of the center of the robot.

Still... it is supposed to be somewhat right since the beam is going along this line.

Oh yeah... I have a 3D model of this thing because I made every part...

I'm pretty sure this STL is broken but I want to see it on Github.

This will always amaze me... I mean this is what I will do with this project. Except it will be tied to real telemetry data/move.

Well this is a rough idea of what it is... it is weird that the beam doesn't go into the ground. This is what I got from the taped-on laser pointer.

This Tarantula pose looks cool but strains the servos (more current consumption) so I don't use it.

Okay I need to get this done, I can feel myself losing effectiveness as the night goes on. Usually on these sleep-pattern reset days I end up killing time by watching tv/doing mindless stuff as I can't function anymore mentally but I'm awake.

After I do this sampling/basic math/obstacle stuff, I will watch other insect quads and see how they walk.

It's funny you see quad designs all over like in Fallout 76 they have these small dog-size quad robots roaming around and I'm like "how the f does it walk?". But I didn't look at it too much.

Ahh this song is so good That's The Way by Led Zep

One main problem is the legs don't lift high enough/start catching on stuff (like the tape on the floor).

3:14 AM

Well the two things are published. I have not done the full video yet but that'll come later once I have the majority of the software stuff working as envisioned.

I'm glad (self pat on the back) as I've fallen into this thing where I'll post about some idea or whatever but it's not real. So I've been trying to refrain from posting/sharing anything unless it's real/I already did it.

Anyway now I'm back to this.

Oh man I'm feeling burnt though. My mind's spent/blank.

I should probably not drink anymore NOS ha... my head feels weird, I can feel my eye sockets.

I need to do some full speed timings and then estimate how many samples I will get/what angles... expected distances.

I think I will finally understand scalar/vectors with this project hopefully. I should... I mean I was a physics/eng major but it was a long time ago/unused and largely forgotten.

I'm going to eat real quick so I can get some energy to continue.

4:06 AM

I feel so fortunate for my cat heh look at him.

Back  to it

I did realize a flaw with my current plan... the robot would completely miss say something small near itself.
So I think I need to change the sampling distance/pattern/frequency.

Something acceptible but not excessive so the robot still primarily gets by using kinematics.

I have definitely lost the drive... I will be done doing physical testing for now. I will work on some geometry/math stuff with SketchUp and JS in the browser.

I am very happy that my robot is now tether-free and in one piece.

Now only software can save it.

I'm spacing out right now, getting distracted by random stuff.
