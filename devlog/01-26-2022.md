Today I'm going to start visualizing/working with real numbers with the IMU.

I have been reading/watching various content about IMUs and how to use them.

I'm not 100% there yet, I've gotten some idea of how it's going to work.

Right now I'm going to just get the ThreeJS visualizer to plot the 3-axes vectors (is that right to say)?

So that I can visualize the real time absolute position of the IMU.

Then I will work on adding the calibration aspects to improve the IMU.

Hopefully the IMU I have on the robot isn't too bad as it's already glued in place ha.

Lmao
