Today I'm going to start visualizing/working with real numbers with the IMU.

I have been reading/watching various content about IMUs and how to use them.

I'm not 100% there yet, I've gotten some idea of how it's going to work.

Right now I'm going to just get the ThreeJS visualizer to plot the 3-axes vectors (is that right to say)?

So that I can visualize the real time absolute position of the IMU.

Then I will work on adding the calibration aspects to improve the IMU.

Hopefully the IMU I have on the robot isn't too bad as it's already glued in place ha.

Lmao

I'm feeling the pump... lesssss go.

On mac

I keep the robot in a drawer while it's not in use, always nice to pull it out.

Like I made that. Ha the Mac's USB is like "whoa whoa whoa, you're pulling too much current man"

What I need to do is sample the IMU and send the value to be processed in the web. It will be done on the robot once I understand what needs to happen.

Interesting ESP is crashing.

This live sensor read is rough, think it's my crappy websocket polling overlap but I am getting it at least every second which is fine for this smooth brain boi at the moment.

This is enough for me to work with for now.
