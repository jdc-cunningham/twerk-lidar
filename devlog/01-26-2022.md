Today I'm going to start visualizing/working with real numbers with the IMU.

I have been reading/watching various content about IMUs and how to use them.

I'm not 100% there yet, I've gotten some idea of how it's going to work.

Right now I'm going to just get the ThreeJS visualizer to plot the 3-axes vectors (is that right to say)?

So that I can visualize the real time absolute position of the IMU.

Then I will work on adding the calibration aspects to improve the IMU.

Hopefully the IMU I have on the robot isn't too bad as it's already glued in place ha.

Lmao

I'm feeling the pump... lesssss go.

On mac

I keep the robot in a drawer while it's not in use, always nice to pull it out.

Like I made that. Ha the Mac's USB is like "whoa whoa whoa, you're pulling too much current man"

What I need to do is sample the IMU and send the value to be processed in the web. It will be done on the robot once I understand what needs to happen.

Interesting ESP is crashing.

This live sensor read is rough, think it's my crappy websocket polling overlap but I am getting it at least every second which is fine for this smooth brain boi at the moment.

This is enough for me to work with for now.

Can see the example live feed below, just dumping the 9 data points

I don't know why but it seems like right now in order to get data from the ESP I have to keep pinging it from the web.

I'm trying to figure out why I'm missing a third vector in my ThreeJS plot.

Oh these are just 3D points and they're being joined damn it...

Yeah I'm doing this wrong.

Eventually I will need ChartJS on here for the visual calibration stuff.

Okay I need to back to the math part and remember how this works, what do I do with these points?

Seems like if the robot is unplugged from the serial monitor it will not send the data to the web app... which is odd...

The 5 second loop in the ESP-01 is what determines how fast the web app can be reconnected.

Yeah for some reason it won't send while the USB wire is not plugged in.

It's odd, once it has started it can keep sending even when I unplug the USB cable.

I'm stuck on this comm issue. It makes my whole thing fail if they can't talk back and forward freely.

I posted at the PJRC site to get some help. Will continue with the matrix stuff briefly. I have to do other things soon.
