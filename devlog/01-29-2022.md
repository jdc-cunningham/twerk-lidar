The word is yes...

I've watched this video so many times "in this video..."

In the video the axis pointing at the ground is whatever is the correct one.

It just doesn't make sense/match with what I've plotted where DEN is plotted but somehow the North line (should be horizontal) is down (green axis).

I've been working a lot lately which is good so I put this aside briefly. It's the weekend now though.

I unfortunately fell asleep early at 8PM and woke up recently it's 3:22 AM now.

I changed the NED result so it's outputting NED vs. DEN.

Then I'll match the axes colors I've set before eg. x red, y green, z blue

Okay I did notice his viewer has axes labels, Down would be my Z, North would be Y and East is X.

But right now down is green (Y), then blue and red are on the same plane.

I made my coordinate frame in ThreeJS to use x, y, z where Z is vertical to match the IMU axes.

What's interesting is if I only plot the N and E outputs, I don't have a vertical blue line.

Omg I got it, it was my material colors being called after plotting.

The rotational axes don't match though... if gravitry is down, I can rotate it away/towards me (robot front facing to my right) and it will appropriately tilt the gravity axes. But if I pitch they're flipped... not sure what that means.

Well let me continue on

I think I'm good, it looks like it generally follows it where the axes pointing into the ground matches what is plotted EXCEPT the North axes, that is not 100% pointing at the ground when I point it at the ground.

Problems with this implementation

Magnetometer problem

Dang this library does not have calibration, I'll have to add that.

I'm tempted to add a visual LED to indicate what the robot is doing like "blink blue to calibrate gyro" kind of thing.

Maybe I can use the Arduino Serial Plotter to do the calibration visually.

Will watch [this serial plotter video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3hiSV-B4v0) once I know what to do.

Actually I'm going to try and plot the mag x, y, z values real quick I should see three lines.

"perfect sphere centered at origin" what does that look like on a 2D graph?

I've seen something before where they just aligned all the lines on a 2D approach.

"Spin it around in all directions"
