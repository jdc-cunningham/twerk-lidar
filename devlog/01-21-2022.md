I did some of my day-job tasks so doing this now.

I want to get past reworking the walking gait.

Then I will start doing the sweep sampling.

I'm still struggling to get this down ha, this forward walking gait.

In the videos I watched they did not "lunge" forward, the forward motion of any legs somehow pulled the robot forward too without some kind of lunging motion.

I've got a stable triangle. I will try:

- front-right leg moves forward
- back-left leg moves up
- legs on the ground "lunge" forward

Then I don't know if it just repeats or will the legs be in the wrong place.

This walking gait is not much better. It also slowly turns to the right.

I think I will add the servo current position tracker thing.

Ideally any future movements would be based on these current/last set positions.

Let me film this
