To recap from yesterday, I was able to prove the angular velocity sum measured by the robot in a sweep phase visually.

The robot when sweeping moves 30 degrees but for some reason it was only moving 15... I'm going to check today the walking gait default stance how it aligns with the sweep command's initial servo positions.

Then assuming those are not aligned/I update it, I should get the full 30 degrees.

Then I'll be able to do the pitch as well, and do a sample/map it.

The mapping I am concerned about from a data-transfer perspective.

It seems that my current design is bad/the two devices eg. Teensy and ESP get out of sync and the serial builds up/fails to get to the web interface.

It's possible (I don't want to do this) I may need to swap how it works where the ESP is a websocket client and the web is websocket server.

On the mac now going to update the servo positions.

It looks better now it doesn't jump

Now to process and see if it moves 30 deg... well I'm still getting 15 degrees of turn huh..

I'll have to verify it again externally

Well... idk how to make sense of that. But at least I can pretty reasonably trust the IMU values

The error seems to be between 0.0045 to 2.015 to 1.63...

So at worst it is 2 deg off.

Which means what? there is this 322.48 max value in inches which is 16 ft?!

But the sensor is rated for 6 ft... really the only thing I care about is the rough dimensions of the robot.

The robot is about 8.5" cubed, which that's a tight measurement, that's when not in motion, in default center walking gait stance (not a mirrored x, trailing leg)

I will probably have to do the initial web plotting (ThreeJS) manually in steps eg. I'll do pitch up, sweep, center sweep, then down sweep... make a mesh out of that and check it against a box/3D in SketchUp

I'll turn off the legs and get max dimensions. It's 10" in this position

This is a cool look but it'll never be like this because the servos are too weak/pull too much current to get up from this position.

Alright let's continue
