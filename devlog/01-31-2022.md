To recap from yesterday, I was able to prove the angular velocity sum measured by the robot in a sweep phase visually.

The robot when sweeping moves 30 degrees but for some reason it was only moving 15... I'm going to check today the walking gait default stance how it aligns with the sweep command's initial servo positions.

Then assuming those are not aligned/I update it, I should get the full 30 degrees.

Then I'll be able to do the pitch as well, and do a sample/map it.

The mapping I am concerned about from a data-transfer perspective.

It seems that my current design is bad/the two devices eg. Teensy and ESP get out of sync and the serial builds up/fails to get to the web interface.

It's possible (I don't want to do this) I may need to swap how it works where the ESP is a websocket client and the web is websocket server.
