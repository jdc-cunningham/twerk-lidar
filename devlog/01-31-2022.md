To recap from yesterday, I was able to prove the angular velocity sum measured by the robot in a sweep phase visually.

The robot when sweeping moves 30 degrees but for some reason it was only moving 15... I'm going to check today the walking gait default stance how it aligns with the sweep command's initial servo positions.

Then assuming those are not aligned/I update it, I should get the full 30 degrees.

Then I'll be able to do the pitch as well, and do a sample/map it.

The mapping I am concerned about from a data-transfer perspective.

It seems that my current design is bad/the two devices eg. Teensy and ESP get out of sync and the serial builds up/fails to get to the web interface.

It's possible (I don't want to do this) I may need to swap how it works where the ESP is a websocket client and the web is websocket server.

On the mac now going to update the servo positions.

It looks better now it doesn't jump

Now to process and see if it moves 30 deg... well I'm still getting 15 degrees of turn huh..

I'll have to verify it again externally

Well... idk how to make sense of that. But at least I can pretty reasonably trust the IMU values

The error seems to be between 0.0045 to 2.015 to 1.63...

So at worst it is 2 deg off.

Which means what? there is this 322.48 max value in inches which is 16 ft?!

But the sensor is rated for 6 ft... really the only thing I care about is the rough dimensions of the robot.

The robot is about 8.5" cubed, which that's a tight measurement, that's when not in motion, in default center walking gait stance (not a mirrored x, trailing leg)

I will probably have to do the initial web plotting (ThreeJS) manually in steps eg. I'll do pitch up, sweep, center sweep, then down sweep... make a mesh out of that and check it against a box/3D in SketchUp

I'll turn off the legs and get max dimensions. It's 10" in this position

This is a cool look but it'll never be like this because the servos are too weak/pull too much current to get up from this position.

Alright let's continue

So the robot is at most a square foot, that's really an over estimation more like 75" of that.

Oh man that' so cool, like I designed that

I'll do 24" (2 ft) scans for now

15 deg is not good enough of a scanning width

I will have to update the sweep to move more

Unless I got farther eg. scan 3ft away

Looks like I can get 10 more degrees (max 180) let me see how that looks.

Oh yeah that looks better

I just want to know that if I scan directly ahead I won't hit anything.

I did have a concern of height, will check that eg. overhead.

That might be overkill to go 25 degrees up.

Ha at 15 deg up it's almost exactly 8.5" nice

The down tilt will be interesting since it's close to the ground already

Hmm if it tilts 15 deg down it'll scan about 7.5" in front of it

I'm getting distracted need to keep going. I did work already today need to use this time, will be busy again most of tomorrow.

Wow the amount it moves now is nuts, let me do another visual confirmation of the rotation

WTF now it's 30 degrees lol

I just added 20 deg to the ending position thinking that's 10 more deg eg. 25

I can check on the spreadsheet

<img src="./media/01-31-2022--30-deg.PNG" width="500"/>

I wanted 30 deg to begin with but I'm just not able to explain it with the servo positions

I have it moving 50 deg right now.
